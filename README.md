# Artisan Marketplace: The Problem

## Why This Matters:

1) **Cultural Extinction**: 1 traditional artisan quits every 10 minutes in India alone (UNESCO).

2) **Exploitation**: Middlemen take 60-80% of profits (e.g., Moroccan rug weavers earn $3/day).

3) **Market Access**: 70% of artisans lack digital sales channels (World Crafts Council).

## Current Solutions Fail Because:

1. Etsy/Amazon favor mass-produced goods.

2. Fair-trade brands mark up prices 10x but don‚Äôt share profits transparently.



## üí° Solution: A Next-Gen Marketplace

### Core Features
#### 1. AI Dynamic Pricing

**Algorithm adjusts prices based on**:
Living wage data (e.g., "This basket requires 8 hours ‚Üí min. price = $45").
Demand forecasting (e.g., Diwali ‚Üí +30% on hand-painted lamps).

**Tech**: Python (scikit-learn) + ILO wage datasets.

**2. AR "Maker Stories"**

**Scan a product** ‚Üí AR overlay shows the artisan crafting it + voice narration.

**Tech**: Unity 3D + Apple Vision Pro/ARKit.

**3. Blockchain Provenance**

Each item has an NFT-like digital passport showing: 
Materials sourced (e.g., "Organic cotton from Gujarat").
% of profit going to the maker (e.g., "65% to Fatima, 10% to dyer").

**Tech**: Ethereum/Polygon + QR codes.

**4. Bulk Order Collective Bidding**

Artisans form DAOs to bid on large orders (e.g., hotel chain needs 500 rugs).

**Tech**: Aragon DAO framework + Stripe Connect.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**:	Next.js (React), TailwindCSS, ARKit/WebXR

**Backend**:	Node.js, Firebase (Auth/DB), AWS S3 (media)

**AI/ML**:	Python (pandas, scikit-learn), GPT-4 (for product descriptions)

**Blockchain**:	Polygon ID (for verification), IPFS (image storage)

**Payments**:	Stripe (fiat), Metamask (crypto)

## üìà Business Model

1. Revenue Stream	Example

2. Commission	10% on sales (vs. Etsy‚Äôs 15%).

3. Premium Listings	$5/month for AR ‚ÄúMaker Story‚Äù tags.

4. B2B Licensing	Brands pay to license artisan designs (royalties split 50/50).

5. Data Insights	Sell anonymized trend data (e.g., ‚ÄúBohemian styles up 20% in EU‚Äù).

## Projected Impact:

1. Artisans earn 2-4x more (based on pilot with 200 Guatemalan weavers).

2. Year 1: 5,000 artisans onboard ‚Üí $2M GMV.

## üöÄ Execution Roadmap
### Phase 1: MVP (3 Months)

1. Build basic Next.js marketplace with Stripe checkout.

2. Onboard 100 artisans via NGO partners (e.g., Fabindia, Ten Thousand Villages).

3. Test AI pricing with 50 products.

### Phase 2: Scale (6-12 Months)

1. Add AR/blockchain features.

2. Partner with ethical influencers for marketing.

3. Launch DAO collective bargaining.

### Phase 3: Expansion (Year 2+)

1. White-label platform for governments (e.g., India‚Äôs "Vocal for Local" campaign).

2. Integrate with physical retail via NFC tags.
