Phase 1: Pre-Hackathon Prep (1-2 Days Before)
1. Define Your Core Hackathon Demo
Since you can’t build everything, pick 1-2 "wow" features to demo. Recommended combo:

AI Dynamic Pricing (algorithmic fairness = unique selling point).

AR Maker Story (visually impressive for judges).

2. Gather Assets
Artisan Data:

Use fake but realistic data for AI pricing (e.g., "Oaxacan rug: 8 hours labor, local min wage = 
5
/
d
a
y
→
m
i
n
p
r
i
c
e
=
5/day→minprice=40").

Source artisan photos/videos from free sites like Pexels (search "weaver," "potter").

Tech Tools:

Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS (quick UI).

AR: Spark AR (no-code) or Unity + ARFoundation (if coders).

AI: Google Colab (pre-built scikit-learn notebook).

3. Team Roles (If Applicable)
Hacker 1: Frontend (Next.js product listings).

Hacker 2: AR integration (Spark AR/Unity).

Hacker 3: AI pricing model (Python notebook).

Hacker 4: Pitch deck/storytelling.

Phase 2: Hackathon Execution (Day 1-2)
1. Build the Barebones Marketplace (4-6 Hours)
Tool: Next.js + Vercel (instant deployment).

Features:

Product listing page (mock 5-10 items).

"Scan for AR Story" button (link to your AR prototype).

AI Price Tag: Hardcode example:

python
Copy
# Pseudo-code for demo (real version uses scikit-learn)
def calculate_price(hours, country):
  wages = {"India": 3, "Mexico": 5, "Morocco": 4}  # $/day
  return hours * (wages[country] / 8) * 2  # 2x multiplier for materials
Display: "This rug: $45 (8 hours @ fair wage in Mexico)".

2. Create the AR Experience (4-5 Hours)
Option A (No-Code):

Use Spark AR or Adobe Aero to overlay a pre-recorded video of an artisan working.

Trigger via QR code on your product page.

Option B (Code):

Unity + ARFoundation: Place a 3D loom/animated hands over a product image.

WebXR: Browser-based AR (no app install).

3. Fake the AI (2-3 Hours)
Demo Hack: Pre-calculate prices for your 10 mock products using a Colab notebook.

Judges Love This: Show the notebook and say, "This scales to 50K artisans with real ILO data!"

Phase 3: Polish & Pitch (Final Day)
1. The "Wow" Demo Flow
Show the marketplace (Next.js site).

Click on a product → reveal AI-calculated price.

Scan QR code → launch AR artisan story.

Drop the mic: "This is the future of ethical commerce."

2. Pitch Deck Essentials (5 Slides)
Problem: "Artisans earn $3/day while middlemen profit."

Solution: "AI pricing + AR stories = radical transparency."

Demo: Screenshot of your AR scan + pricing algo.

Differentiation: "We’re the anti-Etsy—see the maker, pay the maker."

Ask: "We need partnerships with NGOs to scale."

3. Anticipate Judges’ Questions
"How is this sustainable?"
→ "10% commission covers hosting; AR content is crowdsourced by NGOs."

"Why not just use Instagram?"
→ "Instagram doesn’t enforce fair pricing or collective bargaining."

Hackathon Hacks (Cheat Codes)
Steal UI: Copy a Shopify theme’s HTML/CSS, then modify.

Pre-Record AR: If live AR fails, play a screen recording.

Fake Blockchain: Use a mock Polygon scan URL (e.g., "View this transaction on Etherscan").

Final Tip: Story > Code
Judges remember emotion more than tech stacks.

Show a photo of a real artisan (even if fake for the demo).

Say: "Meet Fatima. This platform lets her earn what she deserves."
